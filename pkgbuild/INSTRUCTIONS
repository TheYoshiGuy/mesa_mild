-Instructions :
-
-This is for archlinux, many distribution based on arch should work.
-Any distribution recent enough should work when building from source 
-
-If you know how to compile mesa from source, do not waste your time,  skip directly to "5)"
-
-
-
-Prequisites :
-
-- It's assumed you have at least basic knowledge about makepkg and a working toolchain for both i686 and amd64 
-
-Something you must be aware of :
-- A recent kernel is best, because mesa support and features varies in function of kernel
-
-- You may use LLVM or GCC to build mesa but for LLVM it's best to activate kerberizer repository to grab LLVM (or 32 bits compilation will fail)
-
-
-- Now some radeon specifics :
-There is two radeon drivers for GCN hardware, amdgpu or radeon
-(If you execute 'lspci -k' you will be able to see which one is used)
-
-    - amdgpu needs a special kernel unless you don't care about sound via HDMI or DisplayPort (or if you rely on intel IGD as primary monitor and DRI_PRIME), it provides vulkan 
-
-    - radeon is well supported, but doesn't provide vulkan
-
-
-Ok let's start the process by installing a shiny new stack 
-    
-
-1) Add this repository in /etc/pacman.conf BEFORE the others repositories so you can grab lattest LLVM, kernel and libdrm
-
-[mesa-git]
-Server = http://pkgbuild.com/~lcarlier/$repo/$arch
-SigLevel = Never
-
-2) Install (using pacman) (if it complains force with "-Syudd --force")
-
-# pacman -Syu mesagit linux-amd-staging linux-amd-staging-docs linux-amd-staging-headers
-
-- RESULT: 
-    You have a bleeding edge installation of mesa component and mesa. We will need to replace that mesa later.
-    
-3 ) Tuning before building (OPTIONAL)
-I assume makepkg is installed, aswell as git, the section applies to makepkg.conf
-
-Mesa works well with compiler flags "-O3 -march=native -flto", but I recommend first to make it works fine and after in case you need it to "tune"
-
-wine-staging/gamining-nine doesn't like "-O3" and "-flto", so for it use only "-march=native"
-
-Despite this, if you want to tune at the beginning mesa (but not wine*)
-Try to copy /etc/makepkg.conf to /etc/makepkg-opt.conf
-
-and check CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS values :
-
-CFLAGS="-march=native -O2 -flto"
-CXXFLAGS="-march=native -O2 -flto"
-LDFLAGS="-Wl,-O2 -Wl,--sort-common -Wl,-z,now -Wl,-flto"
-
-For wine-* it would be best like this :
-
-CFLAGS="-march=native -O"
-CXXFLAGS="-march=native -O"
-LDFLAGS="-Wl,-O -Wl,--sort-common -Wl,-z,now"
-
-Explanations :
--flto : Optimization pass at linking time
--O<level> : Choose an optiomization level
--march=native : Use a tuning for the local cpu (ignoring compatibility)
-
-Note : Even if it's not mandatory, if you choose to build wine from git too, you need to build mesa for i686 aswell
-
-4) Building
-- If you want it to be quick you can clone my repository localy and changes "source" URLs in both PKGBUILD like this
-replace :
-source=('mesa::git+https://github.com/mikakev1/mesa_mild_compatibility.git')
-with
-source=('mesa::git+file:///path/on/this/machine/mesa')
-
-There is two sets of PKGBUILD created 
-(it's only a trival modification basically only source and <configure> changes) 
-
-- first is called radeonsi-only. It works with both amdgpu and radeon drivers with GCC and LLVM (from kerberizer) 
-
-- The other add support for intel IGD so you can have an intel IGD as primary GPU and radeonsi for application (DRI_PRIME) . There is a possibility that Cemu works with intel IGDi aswell (with HASWELL or more recent :) ), but I did not test.
-
-- For reliability you'll need to build both amd64 and i686 version of mesa, or wine will probably fail for some applications, and it's better to validate with some steam applications
-
-Download the two PKGBUILDs, switch to a terminal  and go to their location
-
-# cd /"directory where it was extracted"
-
-# makepkg -Ccif -p PKGBUILD.mesa-amd64 
-Install when prompted
-
-# makepkg -Ccif -p  PKGBUILD.mesa-i686
-Install when prompted
-
-Now if you want to build wine, do it, again it's not at all mandatory
-
-
-5) If everything goes well you have now a mesa with four new options of configuration available.
-
-Select these options (for your graphic card) using "driconf" 
-
-"performance"
-    disable "Enable offloading GL driver work to a separate thread"
-"debug"
-    enable "Force GLSL extension default behaviour to warn"
-    enable "Always allow glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS)"
-    enable "Allow more type of primitives in glDrawArray"
-    enable "Special handling of mesa_uniform when location = -1"
-    enable "Bypass some validation related to VBO when using core profile"
-    
-
-Save or close application and it's best if you reboot now.
-
-To launch CEMU (if installed for instance in /cemu/cemu1.8.0)
-Open a terminal
-# cd /cemu/cemu1.8.0
-# "MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.5 wine64 Cemu.exe"
-
-- Check MESA_NO_ERROR is  not set (unless you stick to a stable 17.1)
-- Since version 1.8.0 Cemu fails to start first time (screen related?), I did not experience this in 1.7.5 nor 1.8.0b
-
-6) You need to prevent pacman to erase mesa and its dependencies or you'll endup building it again 
-
-in /etc/pacman.conf add where it fits :
-IgnoreGroup = mesagit
