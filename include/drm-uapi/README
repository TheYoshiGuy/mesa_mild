This directory contains a copy of the installed kernel headers
required by the anv & i965 drivers to communicate with the kernel.
Whenever either of those driver needs new definitions for new kernel
APIs, these files should be updated.

You can copy files installed after running this from the kernel
repository, at version the drivers require :

$ make headers_install INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/path/to/install

The last update was done at the following kernel commit :
